## Notes

This repository serves as a central archive for the numerous textures and skins created for Mine Little Pony.
Each skin is organised into a category (Folder) by their types of character and outfit variation in a format suitable for
inclusion with Minecraft Resourcepacks.

Each folder has its own bgponies.json listing the textures included alongside them and anyone who wished is free to use these
textures for own purposes.

## Information for Contributors

Skin suggestions and requests can be made by submitting an issue to this repository. If you are a skinner yourself,
you can submit textures to this repository by submitting an issue linking your textures, their names, and any other information applicable,
or by creating a Pull Request directly into this repo.

Please note that skins in this pack all have to conform to the same style, Muzzle, Hooves, Eyes, and Ears in particular may be adjusted to match the other skins before inclusion.

Colours are expected to be accurate where possible, using the MLPVector-Club's colour guide where possible.
Only exception is shadow colours and hoof outlines which are generally taken as a darker variation of the coat fill.
